# Hi, I'm Justin

📍 San Ramon, CA | Sales guy learning to code

---

I spent almost a decade at [Sentry](https://sentry.io) - started as an early AE and worked my way up to leading sales. Now I'm at [Infisical](https://infisical.com) helping enterprise customers manage their secrets, certificates, and privileged access.

With AI front and center - Codex, Claude Code, and the rest - I've really leaned into learning as much as I can in my free time when I'm not traveling or pitching Infisical. I'm not going to mass produce any PRs anytime soon, but I've learned more about software development and infrastructure engineering in the last 8 to 9 months than I ever expected. Helping enterprises manage secrets, certificates, and identity at scale every day at Infisical has only made me more curious about how it all works under the hood. I've spent a good amount of my career working with and selling to developers, and eventually you want to understand why and how they're building. It's been really fun.

### What I'm Building

- 🌦️ [16bitweather.co](https://16bitweather.co) - A retro weather app because I'm obsessed with weather
- ⌨️ [weather-cli](https://github.com/deephouse23/weather-cli) - Same obsession, terminal edition
- 🀄 Mahjong for Dummies - Teaching myself mahjong and figured I'd help others learn too (coming soon)

### Outside of Work

I live out in San Ramon with my wife and dog. I'm into CrossFit, cycling, retired breakdancer (age = your skill decreases here), EDM, physics, meditation, and trying to understand how everything connects.

### What I'm Exploring

- Building with and learning to create AI agents
- Turning ideas into working apps faster than I ever thought possible
- Figuring out how to make mahjong less intimidating
